# Lab 1

Use the [pdf](ProblemSolvingBuildingBlocks.pdf) and the files in this repo to create solutions for these problems:

1. Take a distance in kilometers as input and output the same distance converted to miles.
2. Write a loop that asks the user for a number of rows and then prints out a pattern that looks like this:
```
#######
######
#####
####
###
##
#
```
3. Modify the grades program to do all of the letter grades
4. Modify your program from question 1 to handle non-numeric input.
5. Use 2 functions to display the number of vowels and consonants in a string that you prompt the user to enter.
6. If `254` is code for bed, write a program that decrypts a string made from an encoded sentence that the user inputs.
7. Write a program that prints the short form for a month given it's proper name. For instance October => Oct.
8. Write a program to calculate the volume of a cylinder. The user enters in the diameter of the end of the circle, and the height in meters:

volume = pi * r ** 2 * height 

    Input the radius and height
    Output the radius and height as they were input
    Output the volume of the cylinder

##### Sample Output

```
radius >4
height >4
the volume is 201 cubic meters
```

9. Average calorie intake

Within a healthy, balanced diet, a man needs around 10,500kJ (2,500kcal) a day to maintain his weight. For a woman, that figure is around 8,400kJ (2,000kcal) a day.

Write a program that prompts the user to input the number of calories for 7 days and then prints the weekly average.

##### Sample Output

```
Enter your calories for day 1: 2490
Enter your calories for day 2: 2234
Enter your calories for day 3: 2768
Enter your calories for day 4: 2800
Enter your calories for day 5: 2900
Enter your calories for day 6: 2700
Enter your calories for day 7: 2200
Your average calories for 7 days was 2584.5714285714284
```

10. Word count

Write a program with a function that accepts a string as an argument and returns the number of words that the string contains.

Hint Look for whitespace and punctuation

The application should let the user enter a string and should display the number of words that it contains.

```
enter a string >I am just a poor boy from a poor family. Spare me my life for this one atrocity.
the string contains 18 words
```

11. Pig Latin

Write a program that accepts a sentence as input and converts each word to “Pig Latin.” In one version, to convert a word to Pig Latin you remove the letters up to the first vowel and place that letter at the end of the word. Then you append the string “ay” to the word. 
Here is an example:

English: I SLEPT MOST OF THE NIGHT

Pig Latin: IAY EPTSLAY OSTMAY OFAY ETHAY IGHTNAY
